# Decentralized Comments

## Project Description
- DecentralizedComments is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to post comments or reviews associated with any item identified by a unique ID or hash. All comments are stored on chain to ensure transparency, censorship resistance, and data immutability.

## Project Vision
- To build a trustless and tamper-proof commenting system where users can share honest feedback freely, without relying on centralized authorities or being subject to content censorship.

## Key Features
- Post comments linked to any unique item ID 
- Comments are permanently stored on-chain, ensuring immutability and public transparency
- Anyone can retrieve comments along with the commenterâ€™s address and timestamp
- Emits events for every comment, enabling tracking and frontend integrations

## Future Scope
- Community-based moderation and flagging of inappropriate content
- Upvote/downvote or emoji reaction system for comment engagement
- User profiles and reputation tracking tied to comment history
- Integration with decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS) for supporting large media or files
